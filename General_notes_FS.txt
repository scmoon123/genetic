# 243 Project

## Parameters

- Chromosome length C (Given by Dataset)
- Generation size P (bigger is better) (Ideally: C < P < 2C)
- Mutation probability mu (ex. 1% or 1/C)
- Termination criterion: Max number of iterations maxiter
- Objective criterion / function: Default = AIC

## **Required support functions:**

- Mutation
    - Inputs: Chromosome, (Parent Chromosomes?), Mu = Mutation probability
    - Outputs: Mutated Chromosome
- Genetic Operator (Crossover)
    - Inputs: Chromosome parent 1, Chromosome parent 2, Method = Simple random split … more params
    - Outpus: Children chromosomes (1, 2)

    create 
- Rank
    - Inputs: Generation t (P Chromosomes), Objective function
    - Fixed?: Rank based method
    - Outputs: Generation t (P Chromosomes) and their respective Fitness-Score
- Selection
    - Inputs: Generation t (P Chromosomes) and their respective Fitness-Score, … further selection parameters
    - Outpus: Parents selected for breeding before Crossover (Ordered pairs?)
